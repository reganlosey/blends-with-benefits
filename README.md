## [Blends With Benefits](https://blendswithbenefits.netlify.app/), the coffee and tea shop that grinds so fine.
Hey there, hot stuff.
The daily grind can be exhausting, but we're here to help you take life one cup at a time.
So take a deep breath, embrace your inner tranquili-tea, and enjoy the shop that was brewed espresso-ly for you with a whole latt√© love.


## Description

Blends With Benefits is an ecommerce-style application that allows users to browse and purchase a variety of coffees and teas in bulk. The items stored in the cart and orders pages persist on refresh using the `redux-persist` library which rehydrates the Redux store with the data stored in the browser's local storage.

This was a personal solo project and the first full-stack application I've built on my own. I wanted to keep up my momentum after graduating from Turing School Of Software and Design and this was an idea that I had been kicking around for awhile.
This repository is the UI that interacts with the [API](https://github.com/reganlosey/brewed_to_serve) I previously built which serves the data for all of the coffee and tea objects.
This was also a venture for me to gain some more experience implementing Redux for global state management across the application, which I had been wanting to dig into some more to avoid the pain of prop-passing. 
I had a ton of fun working on this project and getting to interact with my own API after only having used 3rd party public API's was really cool.

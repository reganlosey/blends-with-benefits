## [Blends With Benefits](https://blendswithbenefits.netlify.app/).
Hey there, hot stuff.
The daily grind can be exhausting, but we're here to help you take life one cup at a time.
So take a deep breath, embrace your inner tranquili-tea, and enjoy the shop that was brewed espresso-ly for you with a whole latt√© love.


## Description

Blends With Benefits is an ecommerce-style application that allows users to browse and purchase a variety of coffees and teas in bulk. The items stored in the cart and orders pages persist on refresh using the `redux-persist` library which rehydrates the Redux store with the data stored in the browser's local storage.

This was a personal solo project and the first full-stack application I've built on my own. I wanted to keep up my momentum after graduating from Turing School Of Software and Design and this was an idea that I had been kicking around for awhile. I'm also a hopeless coffee addict and pun fanatic (ask me about my punny coffee tattoo!) which was the inspiration for this project.
This repository is the UI that interacts with the [API](https://github.com/reganlosey/brewed_to_serve) I previously built which serves the data for all of the coffee and tea objects.
This was also a venture for me to gain some more experience implementing Redux for global state management across the application, which I had been wanting to dig into some more to avoid the pain of prop-passing. 
I had a ton of fun working on this project and getting to interact with my own API after only having used 3rd party public API's was really cool.

#### Note: Because this application utilizes local storage, the browser's local storage must be cleared if you wish to reset the data. To do so, open your browser's developer tools and in the console, type `localStorage.clear()` and press enter.
